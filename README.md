# password_checker
I developed a robust password checker application designed to enhance online security by leveraging a comprehensive dataset of compromised passwords. This project employs an API that evaluates the vulnerability of passwords and informs users about their security status.

Through the use of cryptographic hashing and API queries, the application ensures privacy while assessing the exposure of passwords. The program takes advantage of a widely-recognized hashing algorithm to convert passwords into unique cryptographic representations before querying the API. The returned data offers insights into the number of times a password has appeared in security breaches. The project's script systematically interacts with the API, orchestrating the query, hashing, and matching processes, ensuring user convenience.

Upon analyzing the results, the application provides immediate feedback, enabling users to take proactive steps to safeguard their digital identities. This password checker significantly contributes to online safety by empowering users to make informed decisions about their password choices, ultimately enhancing their cybersecurity posture.
